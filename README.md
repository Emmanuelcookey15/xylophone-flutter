# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal

In this project I dived more into Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, I had become comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What Il created

Weâ€™re going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
